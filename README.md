CROCO setup file in manuscript submitted to JPO (wu et al.-Wind Variability at Synoptic-to-Planetary Frequencies Enhances Frontal Asymmetry at Mesoscale Eddy Peripheries).  
The .h can be used to compile the CROCO code V1.3(https://www.croco-ocean.org/). CROCO.in is  is a file used to control output parameters.  
The sensitivity experiment configuration is shown in the following figure:
